setting the volume to a random value doesnt work, it needs to have a setup where we have a bot break it down into multiple steps that it is able to do. it should even be able to build a random number generator and execute it if it needs to.

make security camera work more in real time
if it isnt active, then it should slowly fade and then close itself
most recently received command should go ion the left ball
checkboxes should look nicer
clicking somewhere should open habits
putting it into a certain corner could start a pomadoro timer
putting it in a certain corner or something could make my phone silent, maybe..
clicking in system tray should maximize and bring to front

make a message that toggles mute/volume

if it sees motion then it should just start recording video and send me some frames.
