    <title>Detecting the presence of sperm whales echolocation clicks in noisy
  environments</title>
    <summary>  Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) navigate underwater with a series of
impulsive, click-like sounds known as echolocation clicks. These clicks are
characterized by a multipulse structure (MPS) that serves as a distinctive
pattern. In this work, we use the stability of the MPS as a detection metric
for recognizing and classifying the presence of clicks in noisy environments.
To distinguish between noise transients and to handle simultaneous emissions
from multiple sperm whales, our approach clusters a time series of MPS measures
while removing potential clicks that do not fulfil the limits of inter-click
interval, duration and spectrum. As a result, our approach can handle high
noise transients and low signal-to-noise ratio. The performance of our
detection approach is examined using three datasets: seven months of recordings
from the Mediterranean Sea containing manually verified ambient noise; several
days of manually labelled data collected from the Dominica Island containing
approximately 40,000 clicks from multiple sperm whales; and a dataset from the
Bahamas containing 1,203 labelled clicks from a single sperm whale. Comparing
with the results of two benchmark detectors, a better trade-off between
precision and recall is observed as well as a significant reduction in false
detection rates, especially in noisy environments. To ensure reproducibility,
we provide our database of labelled clicks along with our implementation code.

    <title>Cetacean Translation Initiative: a roadmap to deciphering the
  communication of sperm whales</title>
    <summary>  The past decade has witnessed a groundbreaking rise of machine learning for
human language analysis, with current methods capable of automatically
accurately recovering various aspects of syntax and semantics - including
sentence structure and grounded word meaning - from large data collections.
Recent research showed the promise of such tools for analyzing acoustic
communication in nonhuman species. We posit that machine learning will be the
cornerstone of future collection, processing, and analysis of multimodal
streams of data in animal communication studies, including bioacoustic,
behavioral, biological, and environmental data. Cetaceans are unique non-human
model species as they possess sophisticated acoustic communications, but
utilize a very different encoding system that evolved in an aquatic rather than
terrestrial medium. Sperm whales, in particular, with their highly-developed
neuroanatomical features, cognitive abilities, social structures, and discrete
click-based encoding make for an excellent starting point for advanced machine
learning tools that can be applied to other animals in the future. This paper
details a roadmap toward this goal based on currently existing technology and
multidisciplinary scientific community effort. We outline the key elements
required for the collection and processing of massive bioacoustic data of sperm
whales, detecting their basic communication units and language-like
higher-level structures, and validating these models through interactive
playback experiments. The technological capabilities developed by such an
undertaking are likely to yield cross-applications and advancements in broader
communities investigating non-human communication and animal behavioral
research.

    <title>Approaching an unknown communication system by latent space exploration
  and causal inference</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes a methodology for discovering meaningful properties in
data by exploring the latent space of unsupervised deep generative models. We
combine manipulation of individual latent variables to extreme values outside
the training range with methods inspired by causal inference into an approach
we call causal disentanglement with extreme values (CDEV) and show that this
approach yields insights for model interpretability. Using this technique, we
can infer what properties of unknown data the model encodes as meaningful. We
apply the methodology to test what is meaningful in the communication system of
sperm whales, one of the most intriguing and understudied animal communication
systems. We train a network that has been shown to learn meaningful
representations of speech and test whether we can leverage such unsupervised
learning to decipher the properties of another vocal communication system for
which we have no ground truth. The proposed technique suggests that sperm
whales encode information using the number of clicks in a sequence, the
regularity of their timing, and audio properties such as the spectral mean and
the acoustic regularity of the sequences. Some of these findings are consistent
with existing hypotheses, while others are proposed for the first time. We also
argue that our models uncover rules that govern the structure of communication
units in the sperm whale communication system and apply them while generating
innovative data not shown during training. This paper suggests that an
interpretation of the outputs of deep neural networks with causal methodology
can be a viable strategy for approaching data about which little is known and
presents another case of how deep learning can limit the hypothesis space.
Finally, the proposed approach combining latent space manipulation and causal
inference can be extended to other architectures and arbitrary datasets.

    <title>Social learning across symbolic cultural barriers in non-human cultures</title>
    <summary>  Social learning is key in the development of both human and non-human animal
societies. Here, we provide quantitative evidence that supports the existence
of social learning in sperm whales across socio-cultural barriers, based on
acoustic data from locations in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Sperm whale
populations have traditionally been partitioned into clans based on their vocal
repertoire (what they say) of rhythmically patterned clicks (codas), and in
particular their identity codas, which serve as symbolic markers for each clan.
However, identity codas account for between 35% and 60% of all codas vocalized
depending on the different clans. We introduce a computational modeling
approach that recovers clan structure and shows new evidence of social learning
across clans from the internal temporal structure of non-identity codas, the
remaining fraction of codas. The proposed method is based on vocal style, which
encodes how sperm whales assemble individual clicks into codas. Specifically,
we modeled clicking pattern data using generative models based on variable
length Markov chains, producing what we term "subcoda trees". Based on our
results, we propose here a new concept of vocal identity, which consists of
both vocal repertoire and style. We show that (i) style-delimited clans are
similar to repertoire-delimited clans, and that (ii) sympatry increases vocal
style similarity between clans for non-identity codas, but has no significant
effect on identity codas. This implies that different clans who geographically
overlap have similar styles for most codas, which in turn implies social
learning across cultural boundaries. More broadly, the proposed method provides
a new framework for comparing communication systems of other animal species,
with potential implications for our understanding of cultural transmission in
animal societies.

    <title>Thermal unfolding of myoglobin in the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach</title>
    <summary>  The Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm is applied to model the low-temperature
crystallographic C$\alpha$ backbone structure of sperm whale myoglobin. The
Glauber protocol is employed to simulate its response to an increase in ambient
temperature. The myoglobin is found to unfold from its native state by a
succession of $\alpha$-helical intermediates, fully in line with the observed
folding and unfolding patterns in denaturation experiments. In particular, a
molten globule intermediate is identified with experimentally correct
attributes. A detailed, experimentally testable contact map is constructed to
characterise the specifics of the unfolding pathway, including the formation of
long range interactions. The results reveal how the unfolding process of a
protein is driven by the interplay between, and a successive melting of, its
modular secondary structure components.
